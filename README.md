# Big Poppa Code React Starter Kit
This Starter Kit is being created for New Web Developers that want to get started with react

Most people use a CLI Tool like Vue-Cli or Create React App and no idea what these things are doing

The goal of this is for it to be a tool that let's you learn JS at a new level because you have access to
everything under the hood and no opinionated set up

I will base all my tutorials on this Starter Kit.

## Steps


**Start the dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
### or
```bash
yarn dev
```

**Build files for production**
```bash
yarn build
```
### or

```bash
npm run build
```

**Deploy for production script**
```bash
npm start
```
### or
```bash
yarn start
```


This starter kit uses Gulp, Webpack, Browsersync, Nodemon and Babel to create a unified development environment with hot reloading and automatically building files to disk. It uses the concept of `Train How You Fight, Fight Like You Train`. Instead of building files in memory in dev mode, this starter kit builds your files directly to the public folder and statically serves the public folder. This means that the public folder is serving your site just like it would in production and this meant to be a simple full stack react starter kit that any learner can build upon.
